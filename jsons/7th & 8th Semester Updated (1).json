Strata control instrumentation and monitoring aims at\nevaluation and monitoring the trends of changing rock mechanical  parameters, namely,\ndilation, load, convergence, stress and axial loading etc., during mining so that rock mechanical\nun-eventualities are apprehended well before for effective corrective measures. Host rock\ngeometry in coal mining is represented by stratified rock masses of relative weaker strength.\nSuch stratifications are compound and unite in their virgin state before any kind of mining.\nDilation / bed separation causes change in stress from its in-situ state, which in turn is\npropagated in the rocks around. Such induced effect of stress can be revealed in the workings\nwith the help of instrumentation, aiding apprehension of strata movement and subsequent\nassessments.\nCourse Outcomes:\nAfter completion of the course, students will be able to:\n1.\nUnderstand use of instrumentation of in rock mechanics.\n2.\nKnow Causes and impacts of rock failure, rock strength and stresses induced in rocks.\n3.\nUnderstand the time dependent deformation in rock structure.\n4.\nUnderstand the effect of water on rock structure and their stability.\n5.\nUnderstand the dynamic characteristics of rock and rock mass.\nCO-PO Mapping:\nCOs/POs\nPO1\nPO2\nPO3\nPO4\nPO5\nPO6\nPO7\nPO8\nPO9\nPO10\nPO11\nPO12\nCO1\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\nCO2\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\nCO3\n2\n3\n2\n2\n3\n3\nCO4\n2\n2\n2\n3\nAvg.\n3\n3\n2\n2\n3\n2\n2.5\n2\n3\n2.5\n3\nDETAILED SYLLABUS\nModule 1: Load and Pressure Measuring Instruments: Load cells, pressure measuring\ninstruments – stress capsules, stress meters, borehole pressure cells and flat jacks.

When the exploration project develops further into a feasibility\nstudy or a full-scale mining operation, however, then the reclamation process undertaken at the\nexploration stage becomes the first step in the final rehabilitation of the mine. There are many\ndefinitions used in describing reclamation and closure. These include: Decommissioning. This is\nthe transitional period between the cessation of operations and the final closure of that operation.\nReclamation. This refers to the physical aspects of earth moving, regrading and revegetation.\nRehabilitation.\nGoals and outcomes:\nThis course provides the basis for estimating the financial liability associated with a mining\nproject.

In the recent past,\nthere has been tremendous development in the field of Remote Sensing data collection, analysis\nand utilization. The science of Remote Sensing is no more an art of Map making from satellite\nimage. The digital data handling led to the development of GIS (Geographical Information\nSystem) followed by another innovation of GPS (Global Positing System). Remote Sensing\ncoupled with GIS and GPS techniques has dramatically enhanced human capability for resources\nexploration, mapping and monitoring on local and global scale.The application of Remote\nSensing techniques and Geographical Information System(GIS) in various activities including\nresources evaluation, environmental monitoring and Landuse/Landcover mapping etc, have\ngrown considerably during the last three decades and Remote Sensing data products are being\nincreasingly used for plan information at all levels. An essentials pre-requisite to partaking in\nthese opportunities is the building of various indigenous capacities for the development and\nutilization of space science and technology. This has led to a spurt in the demand for qualified\nmanpower.\nThis course is designed to address the following:\n• Understanding the Geo-informatics approach\n• Teach fundamental principles involved in RS and GIS\n• Understand the Fundamentals of Remote Sensing Products\n• Know the Indian Remote Sensing Program\n• Role of Remote Sensing for various surveys and information extraction\n• Know about different software available in RS and GIS\n• Learn fundamental procedures in RS and GIS\n• Teach data integration and defining problems in digital format\nCourse outcomes\nUpon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:\nKnowledge based\n•\nKnow Understand the remote sensing process;\n•\nUnderstand digital data in different and their formats\nMNO712"

Waterfall methodology places emphasis on\nexhaustive documentation, which is difficult to be kept updated with the dynamics project delivery\nenvironment. Agile relies mostly on user stories and acceptance criteria for knowledge management\nwhich is flexible but may not be exhaustive.\nKDD digitises the knowledge currently contained in the project documents into a specified number\nof building blocks represented in inventory relationship format. For the implementation aspects, it\nfollows Agile way of working. By digitising knowledge, KDD brings in the next level of maturity in the\nproject delivery that takes it closer to effective implementation of digital transformation\nprogrammes using enablers such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, Cloud.\nCourse outcome:\nAfter completing this course, students will acquire:\n1.\nA general understanding of how IT projects are delivered by IT companies.\n2.\nDetails of a new project delivery methodology (Knowledge driven development – KDD)\nbased on digitisation of project knowledge.\n3.\nHow KDD may assist Waterfall, Agile and DevOps methodologies.\n4.\nThe potential contribution of KDD in the current wave of digitisation that industry is\nundergoing.\n5.\nApplication of KDD in digitising domain knowledge and enterprise knowledge.\nCourse syllabus:\nMODULE 1: Project delivery and supporting methodologies (4 hrs)\n\nIT Industry from technology and domain perspective\n\nInformation technology – a knowledge-based industry\n\nIT project delivery – An introduction\n\nIT project delivery methodology landscape\nMODULE 2 : Project delivery pain areas and the way forward (4 hrs)\n\nIT project failures\n\nProject delivery pain areas\n\nProject knowledge\n\nMODULE 3.
