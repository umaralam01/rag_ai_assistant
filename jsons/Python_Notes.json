It is an interpreted language means the code is processed at \nruntime, similar to PERL and PHP. Python also supports object-oriented \nsimilar to other high level programming languages like C++, java that \nencapsulate code within the object. For beginners to learn programming, \npython is correct choice. \n \nHistory: \nPython is introduced by Guido Van Rossum during 1985 to 1990 at \nNational Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the \nNetherlands. It is derived from many other languages including ABC, \nmodula-3, C, C++, Unix etc. \n \nFeatures: \n Easy to learn \n Easy to read \n Easy to maintain \n Broad standard library \n Interactive mode\n\n[Page 2] Ranjith Kumar.

Lists \n2. Strings \n3. Dictionaries \n4. Tuples \n5. Sets \n \n1. List: \n List is the most versatile data type in python \n It can be written as a list of comma-separated values between square \nbrackets \n Items in a list need not be a same data type\n\n[Page 15] Ranjith Kumar.

M \n \nCSE, SRITW \n33 \nChapter 7: FILES \nPython too supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e., to read \nand write files, along with many other file handling options, to operate on \nfiles. We can control what kind of operations we can perform on a file with \nthe mode parameter of openfunction. \n \nOpening and Closing Files \nWe use open() function to open a file in read or write mode. To return a file \nobject, we use open() function along with two arguments, that accepts file \nname and the mode, whether to read or write.  \n \nSyntax: \n \nfileobject = open(filename, mode) \n \nHere is a list of opening modes: \nr \nRead-only mode, file must exist \nw \nWrite-only mode, creates or overwrites an existing file \na \nWrite-only mode, write always append to the end \nr+ Read/write mode \nw+ Read/write mode,  creates or overwrites an existing file \na+ Read/write mode, write will append to end \nrb Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is \nplaced at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode. \nwb \nOpens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file \nif the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for \nwriting. \nab Opens a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at\n\n[Page 34] Ranjith Kumar. M \n \nCSE, SRITW \n34 \nthe end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the \nappend mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for \nwriting. \nrb+ Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The \nfile pointer placed at the beginning of the file. \nwb+\nOpens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. \nOverwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not \nexist, creates a new file for reading and writing. \nab+\nOpens a file for both appending and reading in binary format. \nThe file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file \nopens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a \nnew file for reading and writing \n \nThe file object attributes: Once a file is opened and you have one file object, \nwe can get various information related to that file. A list of all attributes \nrelated to file object is here, \nAttribute \nDescription \nfile.closed \nReturns true if file is closed, false otherwise. \nfile.mode \nReturns access mode with which file was opened. \nfile.name \nReturns name of the file. \nfile.softspace Returns false if space explicitly required with print, \ntrue otherwise. \n \nExample: \n# Open a file  \nfileo = open(\"abc.txt\", \"wb\")  \nprint \"Name of the file: \", fileo.name  \nprint \"Closed or not \", fileo.closed  \nprint \"Opening mode: \", fileo.mode  \n \nThis produces the below result: \nName of the file: abc.txt  \nClosed or not: False\n\n[Page 35] Ranjith Kumar. M \n \nCSE, SRITW \n35 \nOpening mode: wb  \n \nThe close method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes \nthe file object, after which no more writing can be done.  \n \nPython automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is \nreassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close method to close \na file. \n \nSyntax:fileobject.close(); \n \nExample: \n# Open a file  \nfileo = open(\"abc.txt\", \"wb\")  \nprint \"Name of the file: \", fileo.name  \n# Close opened file \nfileo.close() \n \nResult: \nName of the file: abc.txt \n \n \nSample program: \nimport os.path \nimport sys \nf1=input(\"enter a source file\").strip() \nf2=input(\"enter a target file\").strip() \nif os.path.isfile(f2): \n    print(f2 +\"already exists\") \ninfile=open(f1,\"r\") \noutfile=open(f2,\"w\") \ncountlines=countcharacters=0 \nfor line in infile: \n    countlines+=1 \n    countcharacters+=len(line)"

It is important to note that \nPython strings can have binary data and not just text. The write method does \nnot add a newline character ′ \\n ′ to the end of the string. \n \nSyntax: \n \n \nfileobject.write(string); \nHere, passed parameter is the content to be written into the opened file. \n \nExample: \n# Open a file  \nfileo = open(\"abc.txt\", \"wb\")  \nfileo.write(\"Python is a great language!!\\n\");  \n# Close opend file  \nfileo.close() \nResult:  \nPython is a great language!! \n \nThe read method reads a string from an open file. It is important to note that \nPython strings can have binary data. apart from text data.  \nSyntax: \n \n \nfileObject.read([count]);\n\n[Page 37] Ranjith Kumar. M \n \nCSE, SRITW \n37 \nHere, passed parameter is the number of bytes to be read from the opened file. \nThis method starts reading from the beginning of the file and if count is \nmissing, then it tries to read as much as possible, maybe until the end of file. \n \nExample: \n# Open a file  \nfileo = open(\"abc.txt\", \"r+\")  \nstr = fileo.read(10);  \nprint \"Read String is : \", str  \n# Close opend file  \nfileo.close() \n \nResult: \nRead String is : Python is"
